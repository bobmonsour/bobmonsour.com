// Base scss file
// Includes all other scss files via @import
// Imported *local* files must have filenames that start with an underscore (excluded on the @import command)
// @import "https://unpkg.com/open-props/open-props.min.css";
@import "reset";
@import "variables";
@import "desktop";
@import "mobile";

// TODO: MUST import open-props.min.css (as above) when developing locally; MUST remove this import line when deploying to netlify as the build process will automatically include Open Props via npm module which also makes use of postcss-jit-props. Need a way to automate this difference without requiring manual intervention.

**It turns out that I decided to make this TIL page after all. Note that while these TILs have [their own RSS feed](/tilfeed.xml), these items will also be included in the site's main feed.**

_While this appeared first on my [Notes](/notes/) page, I have decided to indeed create this very TIL page for things that I have Learned, Linked, or Loved._

> That’s the purpose of my link blog: it’s an ongoing log of things I’ve found—effectively a combination of public bookmarks and my own thoughts and commentary on why those things are interesting. -- Simon Willison

Having just read [Simon Willison's post about his link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jan/7/linkblogs/), I'm considering making a Today I Learned / Linked page. I think it would be a good way to share interesting things I come across. And this Note is an example of what those posts might look like.

They might just wind up in the Notes section, like this one. We'll see.

Was this a bit too meta?

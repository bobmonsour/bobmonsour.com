> "empathy is the fundamental weakness of Western civilization" - Elon Musk (on the Joe Rogan podcast)

This is among the sickest and most midguided statements that I have ever heard from someone in such a powerful position.

Thankfully, we have people like Cory Booker, who as I write this, is speaking on the Senate floor for as long as he is physically able. He is the perfect antidote to Elon's misguided thinking...and I love everything about him.

_Full disclosure: I spent my formative years in New Jersey._

Here is the video of Cory Booker speaking on the Senate floor:

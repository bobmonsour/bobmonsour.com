> "empathy is the fundamental weakness of Western civilization" - Elon Musk (on the Joe Rogan podcast)

This is among the sickest and most midguided statements that I have ever heard from someone in such a powerful position.

Thankfully, we have people like Cory Booker, who as I write this, is speaking on the Senate floor for as long as he is physically able. He is the perfect antidote to Elon's misguided thinking...and I love everything about him.

_Full disclosure: I spent my formative years in New Jersey._

Here is the video of Cory Booker, titled _"Live: Speaking on Trump, Musk, and Americaâ€™s Moral Moment on the Senate Floor."_

> UPDATE (Apr 3, 2025): The live version of the video is no longer available, but here's 11 hours (of the 25). The best summary that I have seen of his speech is this phrase that he used throughtout the speech: **"This is not a left or right moment. It is a right or wrong moment."**

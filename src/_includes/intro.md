Hi! I'm Bob Monsour.

Brooklyn-born, New Jersey-raised, and educated in Florida and Los Angeles, I'm now retired and living in Northern California with my wonderful wife and artist, [Sandra](https://www.tascafineart.com/), and our Portuguese Water Dog, [Soda](/soda/). Our son is out on his own and lives in Los Angeles.

We travel occasionally and I enjoy reading and trying to stay fit. I'm also having fun being a part of the community of web developers who make and use the static site generator [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). A big part of that is maintaining a [website](https://11tybundle.dev) and [newsletter](https://buttondown.com/11tybundle) called the [11ty Bundle](https://11tybundle.dev).

I've had the privilege of working in the technology industry, beginning in the late 70s. I was fortunate to work on a lot of interesting projects with some really great people.

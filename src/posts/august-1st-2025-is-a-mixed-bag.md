It's almost August 1st, and I have mixed feelings about it. Here's a quick rundown of what's on my mind.

- We brought Soda home from the breeder on August 1st and she continues to be an amazinmg part of our family. She turned 9 in June and while slowing down a little, she still has lots of energy and lots of love to give.

- August 1st is the 6th anniversary of my big brother's death. I think about him often, but this day is always a bit rough. On the first anniversary of his passing, [I wrote about it](/blog/losing-my-brother-to-cancer/). This is us, standing outside of our apartment building in Brooklyn, circa 1960.

- Our son is struggling right now and he has an important appointment on August first. It's been rough for all of us, but he's in a safe place and our relationship is on the mend.

- Bozo Trump's tariff cliff is looming, and I'm concerned about the potential economic impact. It's a complex situation that will have a negative impact on the most vulnerable among us.

- Some important U.S. economic data is set to be released on August 1st, including payroll data and the unemployment rate. We will have already had a Fed meeting on July 30th, so this data will be important for understanding the economic landscape.

The world is a complex place and we all have our own challenges from time to time. At this time, the world feels very precarious and uncertain. When that collides with personal challenges, it can be overwhelming. But I know that we'll get through all of this, one day at a time.

This is the first of an occasional roundup of Eleventy releases, related blog posts, and resources.

Why, you ask?

I felt that there was so much happening in the world of Eleventy as I watch the Discord Server, Mastodon, and my RSS reader, it seemed appropriate to step back and put together a curated version of what I'm seeing in the hopes that others might find this useful.

Who knows, perhaps this belongs in an Eleventy newsletter of some sort. If you think so, feel free to drop me a line at bob dot monsour at gmail.

I wanted to share my thoughts on two significant challenges that have captured my attention and how I am choosing to support them: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the need for better gun control in our country (the US). While I've been a supporter to an organization to address one of these challenges for some time, the other has recently earned a place near the top of my list of concerns.

## I'm am an Arab-American

My grandparents immigrated to the U.S. from Lebanon and Palestine. My maternal grandfather was from Ramallah, in the West Bank. My other grandparents and great grandparents came from various parts of Lebanon. They all arrived around 1900. At the time Lebanon and Palestine were part of the Ottoman Empire. When I located the hand-written census records for some of my grandparents and great grandparents, they listed their country of origin as Syria, as Lebanon was not formally formed as a country until after World War I.

I spent my formative years, from 2nd grade through high school in a small beach town in New Jersey. The community consisted largely of Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans, and what you might call Jewish-Americans. I was one of a kind in this community, but it didn't seem to matter to me or to anyone else. Kids were kids, and I made good friends. And I'm pleased to say that many of my friends in New Jersey remain my friends today. In fact, I'm traveling there later this month to celebrate one of my best friend's 70th birthday. We all turned 70 this year.

...but I digress.

I'm not sure what it is, but there seems to be a natural pull to one's ancestral roots, regardless of what they are and how far one's family has assimilated into the culture of their new country.

Perhaps it's been since 9/11, but I've become more curious and far more aware of the political dynamics of the Middle East. I've read a lot about the history of the region and I find the present situation quite heartbreaking.

## Just Vision

For the last 12 years, I have been a supporter of [Just Vision](https://justvision.org/), a non-profit organization that _"fills a media gap on Israel-Palestine through independent storytelling and strategic audience engagement."_

They have produced [award-winning films](https://justvision.org/films). They also produce [Local Call](https://www.mekomit.co.il/) a Hebrew-language news site advancing citizen journalism and an independent media. In conjunction with [972 Magazine](https://www.972mag.com/), Local Call publishes [their work in English](https://www.972mag.com/topic/local-call/).

If this is an issue of importance to you, perhaps you might consider [supporting them](https://justvision.org/ways-to-give).

## The Brady Campaign

More recently, I've become increasingly concerned about the epidemic of gun violence in our country. The number of mass shootings continues to rise, and the number of deaths and injuries from guns is staggering. I won't repeat the statistics here, but I have no doubt that you are aware of the seriousness of this issue.

Most recently, one of my cousins, who just turned 11 years old, was injured in the shooting that took place in Minneapolis. Forunately, he is expected to make a full recovery. But it was a stark reminder of how close to home this issue can get. There really is nowhere to hide from this epidemic.

I friend of mine and organizer of our book club recently hosted a gathering at his home where we heard [Kris Brown](https://www.bradyunited.org/about-us/our-team/brady-leadership/kris-brown), the President of the [Brady Campaign](https://www.bradyunited.org/), speak about the work they are doing to address this issue. I was so impressed with what I heard that I decided to become a supporter of the Brady Campaign.

If this is an issue of importance to you, perhaps you might consider [supporting them as well](https://www.bradyunited.org/take-action/donate-to-brady).

Thanks for reading.

## 1. Introduction

Since I'm learning to play the piano, it's very nice having a piano at home. We're blessed to have a very good acoustic piano in our house. We have a second place and we were there for a week recently. It's the first time we've been away from home since I started learning to play. I was missing daily (well, almost daily) practice sessions. It felt a little strange to practice the day we returned, strange, yet familiar...if that makes any sense.

I've been in touch with a long-time friend on the east coast who I know had also been interested in getting a keyboard for their home. He plays bass in some sort of oldster band in Philadelphia. I knew that he played the piano as I'd heard him play years ago at my brother's house.

Anyway, I recently texted him, asking if he had ever bought one. He had not and suggested that we do some joint research to find one, actually two, that would be suitable.

I agreed and quickly spouted off some of my initial criteria, specifically: full-size, 88-key keyboard with weighted keys; no to minimal synthesizer "stuff"; and the ability to plug in a headset. He replied, "Same."

And with that, I started down the portable digital piano rabbit hole.

## 2. Initial internet scan

Not surprisingly, when performing a search for such things, there are a lot -- and I mean a lot -- of results. Some of these are review sites for musical instruments, loaded with ads. Some are musical instrument e-commerce sites with reviews, kind of like Car and Driver, but for musical instruments (note: these are also loaded with ads). And, of course, if you put in a search phrase like "digital piano reviews weighted keys" into YouTube, well, you [get this](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=digital+piano+reviews+weighted+keys), which includes one called ["Top 10 Mistakes When Buying a Digital Piano"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W-xtHJzU4o). Now I have to stop writing and watch that one. I'll be back in 19 minutes and 6 seconds.

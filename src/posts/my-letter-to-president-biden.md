> Update (July 22, 2024): I want to express my deep gratitude to President Biden for putting our country over his own personal considerations. His decision to not seek re-election is a testament to his character and his commitment to the country. I am grateful for his service and wish him the best. And I heartily endorse Vice President Harris for President in 2024.

In the wake of President Biden's disastrous debate performance last week, I felt compelled to write him a letter via [Whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/share/). I've also written to our local Congressman, Jared Huffman, and our two California senators, Laphonza Butler, and Alex Padilla.

Here is my letter to President Biden:

July 3, 2024

Dear Mr. President,

You have been the most consequential President in my lifetime. I am 68 years old. I have voted Democrat for my entire life. I have the utmost respect for you and what you and your incredible team have accomplished over your time in office. We have been blessed to have you as our President.

It is my absolute belief that the country cannot afford to have Donald Trump in the White House...ever again.

And while I appreciate all that you have done, I respectfully ask that you seriously consider what is in the best interest of the country with respect to your ongoing candidacy for the office of President.

As you know, there are many talented members of the Democrat party, any of which could crush Donald Trump in a contest. I truly believe that your remaining time in office would be much better spent continuing to work on other pressing issues, such as Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, rather than draining your energy on an intense presidential campaign.

For the future of the country, and our democracy, I implore you to seriously consider if continuing your candidacy is in our collective best interest.

With the utmost respect,

Bob Monsour

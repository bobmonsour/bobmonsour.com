> Update: Here's a [list of all of the executive orders issued by Trump in 2025](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025).

`<start rant>`

Here's a list of just some of the destructive things that the Trump administration has done in the few short days since the inauguration...in no particular order:

- A funding freeze on a bunch of shit, including all foreign aid
- The removal of all DEI info on all government websites
- The imposition on 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico
- The firing of all the prosecutors involved in the cases against Trump
- The firing on somewhere between 15 and 20 inspectors general
- The plan to generate lists of FBI agents involved in any way in any of the prosecutions of those involved in the Jan 7 storming of the capitol
- The handing over of the access controls of the Treasury departments payment systems to Elon Musk, which handles $6 trillion in annual payments by the US government
- The contravening of the law enacted to ban Tik-Tok
- The nominating of the most unprepared and unsuited senior government officers that one could imagine (Pete Hegseth for Defense? Kash Patel for FBI? RFK Jr. for HHS? Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence?)
- Releasing, needlessly, water from reservoirs in Northern California as if this water could ever make its way to Southern California, thereby wasting water that could be needed for irrigation in the central valley

And that is just since January 20th...and I probably missed some.

This is starting to make the movie [Idiocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy) look like a documentary.

We're on a bad path and I honestly don't know how to think about this. I am writing this off the top of my head and I can only imagine what else is in store.

No one can keep up with shit and no one knows what else is coming without even considering what the unintended consequences of these actions will be.

I pray, and that's just about all I can do, is that there is a sufficiently useful number of GOP senators that have spines and can stand up to this shit.

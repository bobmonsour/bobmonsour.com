I was tagged by [Anders Thoresson](https://anders.thoresson.se/post/2025/01/blog-question-challenge-2025/) to answer the challenge. I accepted.

## Why Did You Start Blogging In The First Place?

As you can see from the first blog post on this particular blog, I'm coming up on just 3 years of blogging here. This is the first time that I have blogged in any manner that you could call _consistently_. It all started at that time when I discovered [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), the static site generator. I was quite excited to find it and thought that it would be a good way to start writing about something that interested me.

## What Platform Are You Using The Manage Your Blog, And Why Do You Use It?

I use Eleventy to generate this blog and I host it on Cloudflare. I used to host it on Netlify, but the combination of bandwidth usage of this blog and the [11ty Bundle](https://11tybundle.dev) site that I created and maintain had me bumping up against the limits of the free tier on Netlify. So I moved this blog to Cloudflare. As for my use of Eleventy, I like that it is simple and flexible. I can write my posts in Markdown and use Nunjucks for templating. It's a great combination and works well with my mental model of how a blog can be built and maintained.

## Have You Blogged On Other Platforms Before?

Way way back in the early 2000s, I had created a blog using MovableType, an early pioneer in the blogging tool space. I also had a blog on Tumblr for a while. Yet neither of those stuck as I didn't have a particular interest to write about. Being rather introverted, I never felt terribly comfortable writing about personal stuff, though that has changed now that I have this blog up and running and have made a lot of friends in the Eleventy community.

## How Do You Write Your Posts?

I write the posts directly in a VS Code markdown file as I am writing this one. That said, I have outlined drafts of posts in Obsidian in the past as they were just starting points for drafts or possible future posts.

## When Do You Feel Most Inspired To Write?

I can think of two situations when I'm inspired to write. The first is when I've learned and/or built something new that involves using Eleventy in some way. The second is when I have been having some persistent thoughts about a personal episode or health condition. I learn about what I'm writing about by writing about it. It's a way to process and understand what I'm going through.

## Do You Normally Publish Immediately After Writing, Or Do You Let It Simmer?

I sometimes want to publish immediately after writing something. I will definitely proof read my posts before publishing. Yet there have been a couple where I will let it simmer for a day or two as I know that more thoughts will come and that time gives me space to think about what I've written and in those cases, I often have either more to say or want to clarify something that I've alread drafted.

## Whatâ€™s Your Favorite Post On Your Blog?

That's a tough one. If I look at the analytics for my site, since installing analytics, the most read post seems to be [this one about my CSS pipeline](/posts/the-evolution-of-my-CSS-pipeline-part-2/). That doesn't answer the question and it'd certainly not my favorite. I'd have to say that my favorite is the one I wrote about [losing my brother to cancer](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/losing-my-brother-to-cancer/). I revisit it from time to time as I often think about him and the impact that he had on my life.

## Any Future Plans For the Blog?

I just hope to continue writing. I've got a couple of drafts in the hopper and some ideas in my head. And I may consider adding a few [slash pages](https://slashpages.net/). For me, it's about what I call _surfacing_ content, i.e., bring more of myself to the surface...in public...which can be a challenge for me.

## Who Will Participate Next?

I officially tag [Simon Cox](https://www.simoncox.com/) to answer the challenge. We've come to enjoy each others' remote company in the Eleventy community. And he has already agreed to be tagged. So, Simon, it's your turn.

I left the dumpster fire that is Twitter a couple of weeks ago.

There were multiple proverbial last straws that caused me to deactivate my Twitter account.

It started with Musk tweeting the first of what seemed like several conspiracy theories, including one about the attack on Paul Pelosi.

It ended with the suspension of several prominent journalists.

While I will miss following a wide variety of people, including local friends, a great list of historians, and several journalists, I will not miss the noise and the direction that Musk is taking the site.

All that said, I've moved over to Mastadon and for anyone interested, you can find me there at [@bobmonsour@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@bobmonsour). Mastadon is growing on me and it definitely feels quite a bit friendlier.

We've been spending the last few days in Carmel CA, a truly beautiful place. The beach is our favorite place. Our dog, Soda, can run off leash and play around with all the other dogs and we can get a nice refreshing walk into our day. Yesterday, the sunset was amazing. I took a few photos and wanted to share them.

When does 1 + 1 equal 2? Well, in javascript, if those '1's are numbers, then yeah, it does equal 2. But when the '1's are strings, then it equals 11. And that brings us to the fact that today is the 2nd birthday of the 11ty Bundle.

But first, here's what I wrote in [Issue 1 of the 11ty Bundle blog](https://11tybundle.dev/blog/11ty-bundle-1/) (which was orginally a post on my personal site):

> I felt that there was so much happening in the world of Eleventy as I watch the Discord Server, Mastodon, and my RSS reader, it seemed appropriate to step back and put together a curated version of what I'm seeing in the hopes that others might find this useful.

In this post, I'll take a look back at some of the highlights of the last year.

## Introduction

When does 1 + 1 equal 2? Well, in javascript, if those '1's are numbers, then yeah, it does equal 2. But when the '1's are strings, then it equals 11. And that brings us to the fact that today is the 2nd birthday of the launch of [11tybundle.dev](https://11tybundle.dev/).

But first, here's what I wrote in March of 2023 as part of [Issue 1 of the 11ty Bundle blog](https://11tybundle.dev/blog/11ty-bundle-1/) (which was orginally a post on my personal site):

> ...it seemed appropriate to step back and put together a curated version of what I'm seeing in the hopes that others might find this useful.

And 2 years later, here we are.

For those of you interested in my recap of the first year, see [this post](/blog/the-11ty-bundle-continues/).

## Highlights

Here's are some of the highlights of the last year...in no particular order:

- We crossed the 1,100 post mark in June
- Redesigned the [home page](https://11tybundle.dev), featuring the latest 11 releases, posts and sites
- [Created some node scripts](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/node-cli-of-my-dreams/) to make the site easier to maintain
- Added a bunch of metadata to the [Starters](https://11tybundle.dev/starters/) page, including number of GitHub stars, date of last update, version of eleventy, and link to demo (if available)
- Added the author's number of posts, a link to their website and RSS feed ([if detectable](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/got-rss-feeds/)) to each post's summary
- [Sara Joy](https://sarajoy.dev/) released [11ty Themes Joy](https://11tytheme.sjoy.lol/) for theming the [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) starter
- [Upgraded the site to Eleventy v3](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/upgrade-and-debug/)
- Commissioned [Andy Carolan](https://www.andycarolan.com/) to create the awesome illustration at the top of this post
- Created several new categories: [Drafts](https://11tybundle.dev/categories/drafts/), [Scheduling](https://11tybundle.dev/categories/scheduling/), [Upgrading](https://11tybundle.dev/categories/upgrading/), [Analytics](https://11tybundle.dev/categories/analytics/), [Obsidian](https://11tybundle.dev/categories/obsidian/), and [Notion](https://11tybundle.dev/categories/notion/)
- Eleventy arrived on [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventy_(software)>)
- Added style to [the RSS feed](https://11tybundle.dev/feed.xml) and limited it to the most recent 20 posts
- [Moved the site to Cloudflare Pages](https://bobmonsour.com/notes/11ty-bundle-moved-to-cloudflare/)
- The [Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/) continued to rock and I gave [a talk on how I built my Books page](https://bobmonsour.com/notes/11ty-meetup-how-i-built-my-books-page/)
- Speaking of books pages, a raft of other 'how they made their Books' pages posts showed up this year: [Spencer's](https://www.spencerharston.com/posts/2025/creating-a-books-page/), [Chazz's](https://thisguise.wtf/blog/2024/12/06/building-a-goodreads-bookshelf-for-11ty/), [Jose's](https://vzq.wtf/blog/bookshelf/), and [Melanie's](https://melanie-richards.com/blog/new-reading-page/) (possibly implying the need for a new category)
- I added a GitHub-style 'Type / to search' capability to the site, and I [wrote about how I did it](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/a-keystroke-to-place-focus-in-the-search-box/)
- Finally, in [Issue 70](https://11tybundle.dev/blog/11ty-bundle-70/), dated April 1st, I attempted to [Rick roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) everyone my readers; some took the bait, but few admitted it

## Analytics

### Prior year report: May 2, 2023 to Apr 30, 2024

Note that this does not include a full year in 2023 as I didn't start using [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) until July, 2023.

![Fathom Analytics: Jul 31, 2023 through Apr 30, 2024](/assets/img/fathom-2023-2024.jpg)

### Last year: May 2, 2024 to Apr 30, 2025

![Fathom Analytics: May 1, 2024 through Apr 30, 2025](/assets/img/fathom-2024-2025.jpg)

That looks like a decent uptick in 'People' showing up. I'm guessing most of those, so-called 'People,' come to search for something since there are a lot of hits to the home page and are referred by 'Direct/Unknown.' That and a nice uptick on 'Avg time on site.'

> A note on how Fathom counts 'People': According to their docs, **"...if the same person visits a site three days later, for example, theyâ€™re a new unique."** So, I expect that the number of 'People' is rather inflated. That said, the numbers did indeed to up and the time on site too a nice uptick as well.

## Content stats

Over the last year (since May 2, 2024):

- Added 352 posts
- Added 336 sites
- Added 113 releases
- Published 31 'Issues' of the [11ty Bundle blog](https://11tybundle.dev/blog/)

Year-to-date (since Jan 1, 2025):

- Added 145 posts
- Added 123 sites
- Added 56 releases

Totals as of May 1, 2025:

- [1,452 posts](https://11tybundle.dev/firehose/)
- 451 [Authors](https://11tybundle.dev/authors/)

> **Needless to say, Eleventy's momentum continues!**

## Community

The first ever 11ty conference took place in May 2024. For anyone who missed it, here's the [full playlist of presentations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhCq3ZFGOGgetCSWisU2pkl9AFwQVxWJ).

And, as noted earlier, the [Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/) continued to rock. Check it out for upcoming events and past recordings.

I continue to find new people using Eleventy on [Mastodon](https://neighborhood.11ty.dev/@11ty/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/11ty.dev), and the [Discord server](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/discord/). And I add people to my RSS reader on a regular basis. _Note: those Mastodon and Bluesky links are to the 11ty accounts._

For those of you new-ish, or even old-ish to 11ty, the [Discord server](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/discord/) is filled with talented and helpful people...too many to name here. But if you are looking for help, or just want to hang out with some like-minded folks, I highly recommend it.

I have to say that it's an awesome community and I am grateful to be a part of it. I try to help out when I can, answering a question or two here and there.

Most of the effort goes into finding new posts and sites to add to the bundle, and to keep up with the latest releases. I also write [11ty-oriented posts](/tags/11ty/) when I either learn or implement something new. It's like learning and teaching at the same time.

## What's next?

I've got some ideas for improvements. A few things kicking around in my head:

- Add a 'Books' category for posts about creating a 'Books' page
- Flesh out the [Authors page](https://11tybundle.dev/authors/) to show the most recent few posts by each author, similar to the way the [Categories page](https://11tybundle.dev/categories/) works
- Change the primary Authors page to be sorted by post count in descening order, with the secondary page sorted by name (reverse of the current scheme)
- Redesign the home page to give greater visual weight to the most recently authored posts, over the releases and sites (yet still showing 11 of each)
- Figure out the best way to show the awesome illustration by Andy Carolan on the home page

If any of you have ideas for improvements, please hit the 'comment by email' link at the end of this post.

## Conclusion

With the scheduled release of v70.0 (of me) later this year, I have to say that it's been a good year, life's side trips nothwithstanding. I continue to find purpose in this work and I enjoy engaging with this smart, inspiring, thoughtful, and helpful community.

I also feel as though I've found a voice that let's me write things, not just [about 11ty](/tags/11ty/), but [personal](/tags/personal/), [political](/tags/politics/), and [health-related](/tags/health/) subjects as well. And I'm not sure that would have happened without this work as a catalyst. And for that, I am deeply grateful.

Here's to another fruitful year for all of us!

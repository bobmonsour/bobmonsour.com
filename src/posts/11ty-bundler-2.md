This is Issue #2 of an occasional roundup of Eleventy releases, related blog posts, and resources. Back issues (or, in this case, back issue) can be found under the 11ty Bundle tag link above.

Perhaps this belongs in an Eleventy newsletter of some sort. If you think so, feel free to drop me a line at bob dot monsour at gmail.

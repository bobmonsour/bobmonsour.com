By now, you've all been wondering about the red and blue colors on this site. Where do they come from? Why those colors?

Well, you see, when I was a kid, I had a pen, a pen whose click I just loved. And I liked the way it wrote, the way it laid down its ink on the paper. About 10 years ago, I bought one of those pens again.

And this year, as I was redesigning this site, I decided that I wanted to buy a particular color pen of this brand. I wanted a red one.

You see, it's a [Parker Jotter](https://www.parkerpen.com/jotter-pens.html), a classic pen design. And, like me, it's been around for decades.

And here's a fascinating tidbit from the daily life of me and my wife. We subscribe to the [Britbox](https://www.britbox.com/) streaming channel and we enjoy the murder mysteries in particular. And I have to confess that Parker Jotters make occasional cameo appearances. And, much to my wife's consternation, every time I see one, I have to exlaim "That's a Parker Jotter!" So, the next time you're watching a British murder mystery, be sure to notice those Parker Jotters.

So, back to the question at hand. Clearly, the red on the site comes from the outside color of the pen, as you can see in this image. But the blue, where does the blue come from? Of course, it's the color of the ink. It took a little digging, but I managed to find the closest colors that I could to match these.

Now that that mystery is solved, you can go about your lives without the burden of this burning question.

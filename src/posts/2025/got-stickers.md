I've teased this on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@bobmonsour/114535942160630118) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bobmonsour.com/post/3lpk7t27wnc25), but the time has arrived for the launch of the **11ty Bundle sticker**! Designed by [Andy Carolan](https://www.andycarolan.com/), it's 4" x 2" with a matte-finish.

They're ~~$5.00~~ **now only $3.00** each. Tax & shipping are included in the price and I'll (do my best to) ship them to anywhere in the world (fingers crossed). This is pretty close to my cost.

As of today, May 27, 2025, I've got 49 of them left, and I'm not sure I'll do any more.

I might write a blog post about how the numbers work out once I have some order data and observe the variation in [Stripe fees](https://stripe.com/pricing).

[Go get one from my shop](/shop/)! (that's called a "call to action" in the biz, right?)

And if you go to my [shop](/shop/), you can see what it looks like on my laptop.

Hat tip to [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/) for the idea of using [Stripe's payment links](https://stripe.com/gb/payments/payment-links) to get this up and running quickly. [Robb's got stickers too!](https://rknight.me/blog/dont-at-me-stickers/)

[Go Get One From My Shop](/shop/)! (see what I did there?)

And if you're wondering who makes the stickers, I went with the [Kiss Cut Stickers](https://www.stickergiant.com/kiss-cut-stickers) from [Sticker Giant](https://www.stickergiant.com/).

On a process note, I made my intial request by email to Andy on Friday, May 16, sharing the Sticker Giant artwork specs. He delivered on Monday, May 19. I uploaded the artwork to Sticker Giant the same day. They emailed a proof that same day, shipped on May 20, and I had them in my hands on May 24. Idea to reality in 9 days. Not bad!

Next steps: (1) [ask for orders](/shop/) ([underway](/shop/)), (2) get [Global Forever stamps](https://store.usps.com/store/stamps/stamps/forever/1-65/_/N-9y93lvZ1uq0torZ1gux5bc) from the post office, (3) get envelopes, and (4) ship 'em!

You've read this far, it's time to [GO GET ONE FROM MY SHOP](/shop/)!

Finally, if you do decide to buy one and put it on your laptop (or anything else), I'd love to see some images shared on social media. You can find me on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@bobmonsour) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bobmonsour.com).

_**P.S.** It took me longer to write and edit this blog post than all the other time I've spent on this project...all for a silly little sticker._

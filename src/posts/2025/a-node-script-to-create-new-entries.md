It's fascinating how seeing someone else do something can inspire you to do the same.

I was catalyzed by a video that I watched. The video was created by [DeepakNess](https://deepakness.com/) and here is his [blog post](https://deepakness.com/blog/create-posts-faster-11ty/) about it.

{% set videoTitle = "Create New Posts Faster in 11ty" %}
{% set videoId = "UNrFBDnrz40" %}
{% include 'youtube.njk' %}

I thought it was a great idea and decided to make one for this site. And I used it to create this entry and I now love this process and I expect it will cause me to write and share more of what I'm learning

And yes, I also used AI to create mine.

I've put the [script on GitHub](https://github.com/bobmonsour/mkbo).

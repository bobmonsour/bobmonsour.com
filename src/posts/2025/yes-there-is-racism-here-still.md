I've read Bryan Stevenson's book [Just Mercy](https://bookshop.org/p/books/just-mercy-adapted-for-young-adults-a-true-story-of-the-fight-for-justice-bryan-stevenson/fc0eb330103c424d?ean=9780593177044&next=t) and watched the [movie adaptation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVQbeG5yW78) (the trailer video). Both are powerful and eye-opening, shedding light on the systemic racism and injustices prevalent in the US legal system.

And here is Bryan sharing his experiences as a Black lawyer in the US:

I am not at all shocked by this, but I'm very disappointed.

And here is the full interview from which that short clip was taken:

I wrote [a TIL the other day](/blog/on-rss-entry-ids/) describing how [Evan Sheehan changed how he created IDs](https://darthmall.net/2025/on-the-importance-of-stable-ids/) for each entry in his RSS feed.

Well, I've undertaken a similar effort to accomplish the same thing. I'll have more to say about the gory details in a coming blog post.

> Update: [That blog post has arrived](/blog/creating-permanently-unique-entry-id-for-rss/).

The only reason I did this was that after studying his post, I simply could not let go of the idea. I was thinking about how I would go about it all weekend. And now it seems that I got it to work. It was the only way to get it out of my head.

If you want a sneak peek at the result, just do a view source on the [RSS feed for the TILs](/tilfeed.xml) and examine the id of this entry versus the ids of all the prior entries.

I'm grateful to Evan and for the gift of having the time to futz and fiddle with small pieces of this site...even for those things that make it better in some small way.

Chalk this one up as a _**Today I Loved**_.

These days, I see more and more people details of what they've done each week.

I happened upon [this post by John SJ Anderson](https://genehack.blog/2025/05/weeknote-34-20250511-20250517/), aka genehack. In this recent weeknote, he mentioned Zottman curls. I had not heard of these before. I was curious and looked them up.

If found this YouTube video by Scott Herman Fitness.

{% set videoId = "ZrpRBgswtHs" %}
{% include 'youtube.njk' %}

I decided to give them a try. Today was my 3rd workout in the gym since my knee replacement 10 weeks ago.

I typically do curls with 20 pound dumbbells, varying the kind of curl. Sometimes doing hammer curls and sometimes regular curls.

I figured I'd have to go lighter for the Zottman curls and I was right. Unfortunately, our gym does not have 2.5 pound increments for their dumbbells. So I went with 15s.

I found the Zottman curls to be challenging, particularly the eccentric part of the curl, when doing it slow and controlled. It blazed my forearms, as predicted.

I think I'll be working these into my workouts from time to time.

Thanks for the idea, John!

Inspired by [Tom's site](https://ttntm.me/), after he had [said the following on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ttntm/114083662013477927):

> I've also added tags to the homepage: an additional way to discover what I wrote over the years. -- Tom Doe

So, I've done the same thing on [my home page](/), that is, added a list of all the tags on this site across the [blog](/blog/), [notes](/notes/), and [TIL](/til/) sections.

Thanks, Tom!

My wife and I are visiting Carmel-by-the-Sea, California today, on our way down to Pasadena. We took our dog [Soda](/soda/) for a walk on the beach. It was a beautiful day. The tide was low and 4 to 6 foot shorebreak was crashing unusually hard on the sloped shoreline. As a former surfer, I love these sounds. So I pulled out my phone and captured 2 minutes of it. There are some awesome crashing sounds in there.

P.S. In case you're wondering, that image you see at the top is of the Atlantic Ocean, taken from a trip to the Margate City, NJ a few years ago.

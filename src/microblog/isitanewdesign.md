I'd been wanting to redesign my personal website for a while. I've had sketches and ideas, but no will to get started. Then, finally, a couple of days ago, I sat down and started futzing.

What you're seeing now is a modified site design and not exactly something I'd call a complete redesign. It's more of a simplification with some new functionality. The home page is now more an introduction to who I am instead just a list of the last 3 blog posts. I've shifted some of the top nav to the footer, added a crapload of social icons to the footer, and added this new [microBlog](/microblog/) section.

What you're reading now is the 2nd post of the [microBlog](/microblog/). It's intended for short pieces like this one. It's been a while since I had blogged anything of substance and I wanted to reduce the friction of writing and not worry about the length and depth of each post. Also, on the main blog, I've always had a habit of having a hero image and I wanted to eliminate the need for that effort.

The [microblog](/microblog/) has its own [RSS feed](/microfeed.xml). ~~I may change the main feed to also include these posts, but for now the main blog and this thing will have separate feeds.~~ **The [main feed](/feed/xml) now includes these microblog posts as well as the main blog posts. Friction has been offically reduced for those pre-existing subscribers.**

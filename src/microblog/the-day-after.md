We flew from San Francisco to Rome yesterday. When we landed in Zurich on the first leg of the trip, I immediately switched to the eSim I'd purchased, got access to the local cell network, and opened the Washington Post app on my phone, only to be greeted with the distressing news of Trump's victory. I was stunned. I couldn't believe it. I was in shock. I was in disbelief. I was in denial. I was in despair. I was in mourning.

Thankfully, after arriving in Rome and getting to our hotel, placing our bags down, and walking a single block, we found ourselves, quite intentionally, in Saint Peter's Square.

And after a night of very deep sleep, I have awoken refreshed and I'm going to do my best to purge the US from my mind, at least for a time.

This is a beautiful city and we have a lot to see and do.

I hope you all are safe and well.

description: After an eventful day, I'm feeling much better...for several reasons.

Well, yesterday day ended well and I feel a helluva lot better. Here's why:

- I got Dropbox working on my laptop, so it's coming with me to Italy.
- I solved an Eleventy problem that was causing me serious grief. I decided that I wanted to have the main feed of this blog include these microblog posts rather than having a separate feed. While in the end, the solution was simple, I groped for way too long.
- The appointment with the orthopedic surgeon went well. It was good news, bad news. The good news is that I have the surgery scheduled. The bad news is that it's scheduled for March 6, 2025. We're planning another trip to Europe in May, so that might be tight. I've been put on the waitlist in the event a cancellation occurs. If not, and I'm still in a walkable condition, I'll have it done after the May trip (though I'd prefer to enjoy the summer not in physical therapy).

I'll write more from Italia! Ciao!

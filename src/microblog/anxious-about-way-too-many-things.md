Just a dump of things I'm anxious about right now:

- The election tomorrow. That's all I need to say about that...except that I sure hope Kamala wins.
- We're flying to Italy tomorrow. It should be a fun trip, but I'm always worried about this kind of trip. It's everything from making sure I've packed everything to the flight being on time. If I had to bet though, it's all probably going to be fine.
- Dropbox on my laptop is shitting. For some reason, sync'ing has stopped and appears stuck. I've tried a bunch of stuff with no success. Perhaps this is God's way of telling me that I should not be taking it on the trip. We'll see.
- I've got an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon today as it's time for me to get my other knee replaced. I've tried physical therapy, I've been doing a lot of strength training, but the grinding and getting into the car is getting pretty painful and I think that there's no other way out. I wrote about my first knee replacement in [this post](/posts/my-winding-road-toward-knee-replacement-surgery/). And while I know what to expect, I'm not looking forward to this at all.
- Our 30-year-old son struggles with what I'd call "doing life." This is a constant worry, but moreso recently.

Well, I said I'd wanted to write more and I thought I'd take this opportunity to do so. If I can't get my laptop working, you won't be hearing from me here until we get back (in a couple of weeks). If I can, I'll be posting from Italy.

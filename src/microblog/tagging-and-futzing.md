title: Tagging posts and 'futzing' with my site
description: I've spent some time adding some more descriptive tags to my posts. I call this phase of blogging "futzing."
tags:
  - blogging
  - futzing

I spent a few hours mulling over this website and _futzing_ with it. I tweaked some CSS to simplify things. And I decided to add more tags to some of my posts. The personal category was a bunch of odd stuff. Those posts also have tags like travel, politics, and health.

I'm having second thoughts about calling this section of the site a microBlog and seeing a lot of other people call their similar setups as "Notes." That said, I don't want to go through the headache of creating a the necessary redirects to make that change. Anyway, it's staying as it is, at least for now.

The other change I'm mulling, i.e., further _futzing_ is to organize my posts in yyyy/mm/dd directories and have similarly matching permalinks. I'm also not sold on this one as I do get some value looking at all of my post titles in a single list in VS Code. I'll mull this over, but am unlikely to make that change as well. Maybe in 10 years, when I'm really old, can't see very well, and want to find things by year. My memory might be shot by then, so groping for a year may cause undue frustration for my aging brain.

Anyway, I'm just writing this note to record this particular episode of _futzing_ and am wondering if it was really worth it. I think it was.

The site, Grammarist, [describes the word _futz_](https://grammarist.com/usage/futz-vs-putz/) as follows:

> Also of Yiddish origin, futz is commonly used when talking about someone who is wasting time or not being productive. Similar to putz, itâ€™s also used as a way to describe someone who is lazy or not taking their responsibilities as seriously as they should be. Farting around is a more modern take on it.

That concludes this session of _"farting around."_

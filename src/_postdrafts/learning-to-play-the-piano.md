## Introduction

Well, a new year has started and while I rarely write new year's resolutions, the combination of the new year and some other audio and mental murmurings got be interested in learning to play the piano. Here's a brief look at my brief journey so far.

<div id="section2"></div>

## Why now?

I've never been a musician. My father and brother both played piano, clarinet, and saxophone. I took piano lessons when I was very young, but it didn't stick, while my brother played his whole life. So, I grew up listening to him practice and play. He was really good, though our mother got tired of the practice at times.

I'm not sure why, but I wound up in possession of my brother's clarinet at some point. About 6 years ago, I decided to take it into a music shop and asked to have it refurbished. I then proceeded to start clarinet lessons. I was really enjoying it as I love the sound of the instrument. Then, as luck would (not) have it, I suffered a sudden loss of hearing in my left ear. Doctors attempted to treat it, but the treatments were unsuccessful. After a while, I attempted to resume playing, but the nature of the clarinet, my one-sided hearing combined with the resulting bone virbations when playing, the whole thing became unenjoyable. I still love the sound of the clarinet, just not the one that's in my mouth.

Time has passed and with my brother passing away from cancer, my sister-in-law asked me to go through some of the many boxes of things he had in their attic. Much of this was held over from when my brother cleared out the attic of our childhood home after our mother passed away in 1996.

Among the items in these boxes were stacks and stacks of sheet music. Music for clarinet, saxophone, and mostly piano. So I packed it all up and shipped it from their home in New Jersey to our home in California. I proceeded to go through it all and found quite a few pieces that were clearly my father's as they were dates from the 1930s to the 1960s. I kept a stack of the music, mostly the piano music and began to search for a home for the rest. I reached out to the head of the music department at a local community college and they embraced the idea, saying that they would share it with students; a definite win-win.

Finally, I've always enjoyed the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim, the Brazilian composer, pianist, guitarist, songwriter, arranger, and singer. I have several of his albums and I find the music to be among the most soothing I've ever heard.

I had dabbled via trial and error to play a few of his melodies, and while that can be fun, without the chords (and any real competence) my energy level to pursue these pieces would fizzle.

It was time to get started...for real.

OUTLINE

1. Introduction
2. Why now?

- clarinet
- sheet music from my father and brother

5. But I want to start playing real music...now

- patience is key
- logging my practices

- by keeping my practice log visible

7. So, how's it going?

- Enjoying the distraction
- Finding peace at the keyboard (takes the edge off the frustration)

Here I sit, 7 days after having a total knee replacement of my left knee. I had my right knee done 5 years ago and am very happy with the result. And, hopefully, this one will be as successful.

I am writing this to share a couple of resources that have been very helpful to me.

I have written a couple of blog posts prior to each of my surgeries. You can find them here:

- [My winding road toward knee replacement surgery](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/my-winding-road-toward-knee-replacement-surgery/)
- [Knee replacement 2.0, things have changed
  ](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/knee-replacement-2-things-have-changed/)

But the two other resources that have been very helpful to me are this book.

	</a>
	<p class="bktitle"><a href="https://amzn.to/4kRm8tU">The Knee Book</a></p>
	<p class="bkauthor">by Dr. Adam Rosen</p>
</div>

And the second one is [Dr. Rosen's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dradamrosen). It is filled with solid advice and information about every aspect of dealing with knee pain and knee replacement surgery.

Here's one of his more recent videos, to give you a flavor.

If you want to reach out with questions, please use the _comment by email_ link below and I'll do my best to answer them or point you to other resources.

> UPDATE (2025-03-15): I forgot to add another excellent community-oriented resource. It's called [BoneSmart](https://bonesmart.org/). And specific to knee health, they have several forums where you can ask questions and hear from others who have dealt with similar issues. [The forums are here](https://bonesmart.org/forum/). There is a free tier which is very helpful as well as a paid tier that offers additional features.

_P.S. I'd been wanting to write this for a couple of days, but the first week after knee replacement surgery is a bit rough and I just could not get my mind clear enough to write. Thankfully, I'm on the other side of that now._

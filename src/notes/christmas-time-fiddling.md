title: Final Christmastime Fiddling
description: I spent the last several days fiddling with this site. I changed the microBlog terminology to call them notes and I built a bookshelf page.

I don't know what causes this, but every few weeks or so, I get this urge to do something to this website and I just can't let it go. This time, the big thing that landed was the creation of the [books](/books/) page.

The other thing niggling at me was the use of the term microBlog for a section of the site. I had become uncomfortable with that term and decided to change it to [Notes](/notes/). I've also had to change the default og image for all of the Notes posts. I'm curious to see how the new one works when I post this on Bluesky and Mastodon.

Of course, I created a branch and worked on both of these things in that one branch...probably not the best approach. But I get in these moods where I have all that I need to do in my head, so I just try to blast through it.

But before I could merge the _finished_ branch into main, I had to consider all the redirects that I'd have to create for the microBlog to Notes change, including the RSS feed for the Notes section.

Everything appeared to go reasonably well, until I discovered that due to my use of [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app/), all of the posts in my Notes section were blasted to Bluesky and Mastodon as they all looked new. Lesson learned. I have since removed this site's feed from EchoFeed and kept the [11ty Bundle](https://11tybundle.dev) feed there, where I find it to be a godsend.

I'm pleased with the overall result. And now I need to go and wrap some presents and get off of this computer.

I read a couple of recent posts about how to move a site from Netlify to Cloudflare. And after my recent bandwidth jump on Netlify, I decided to move about one half of that bandwidth usage, i.e., this site, to Cloudflare. I will write more about this later.

I had one minor hitch in the migration, but it was totally self-inflicted. If things had gone as planned, it would have taken me less than 30 minutes...but no, I had to make it more complicated and it took a couple of hours to get it sorted out.

**Update: I did make a [TIL](/til/) page.**

**Update (July 21, 2025): I no longer have a dedicated TIL page...BUT, there's both a [til tag](/tags/til/) and a [notes tag](/tags/notes/) that you can use to find those posts.**

> That’s the purpose of my link blog: it’s an ongoing log of things I’ve found—effectively a combination of public bookmarks and my own thoughts and commentary on why those things are interesting. -- Simon Willison

Having just read Simon Willison's post about his link blog, I'm considering making a Today I Learned / Linked page. I think it would be a good way to share interesting things I come across. And this Note is an example of what those posts might look like.

They might just wind up in the [Notes section](/tags/notes/), like this one. We'll see.

Was this a bit too meta?

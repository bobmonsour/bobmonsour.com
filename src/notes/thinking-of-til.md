**Update: I did make a [TIL](/til/) page.**

> That’s the purpose of my link blog: it’s an ongoing log of things I’ve found—effectively a combination of public bookmarks and my own thoughts and commentary on why those things are interesting. -- Simon Willison

Having just read [Simon Willison's post about his link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jan/7/linkblogs/), I'm considering making a Today I Learned / Linked page. I think it would be a good way to share interesting things I come across. And this Note is an example of what those posts might look like.

They might just wind up in the Notes section, like this one. We'll see.

Was this a bit too meta?

As I wrap up week 7 of my knee replacement rehab, I've once again _discovered_, _realized_, _came to grips with_...however you want to phrase it, that fitness is not a project.

As much as I would like to think that I can get to the end of this "project," it is not to be and for whatever reason, I have to keep reminding myself of this.

I enjoy building things like this website and the [11ty Bundle](https://11tybundle.dev) and each time I finish a feature or add something, it's done...finito! My mind likes to finish things, like reading a book.

Perhaps one day I'll let this sink in with respect to fitness, and particularly this challenging phase of rehab that I am now living through. I do know that in another 3 to 6 months, this will be a distant memory and I'll be back to enjoying my fitness journey without the pain that comes with rehab.

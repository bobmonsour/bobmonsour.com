**Update (July 21, 2025): I no longer have dedicated Notes or TIL pages. All of my writing lives in the [Blog](/blog/). BUT, there's both a [til tag](/tags/til/) and a [notes tag](/tag/notes/) that you can use to find those posts.**

A few months back, I was high on the idea of creating different types of content for my personal site. The idea that I had at the time was that it would enable me to post more frequently as some of these new types would be short forms. Specifically, I created a "Notes" type and a "TIL" (which stood for "Today I Learned, Linked, or Loved") type. That was then.

Now, with a few, somewhat serious, life complications arising, I find myself sitting here and wanting to write something, but I've managed to create some unnecessary friction in the process. Now I have to decide whether what I want to write is a post, a note, or a TIL.

If life were simpler at the moment, I'd probably be able to make that decision quickly. But with everything going on, I find myself hesitating and overthinking it. And as a result, I am not writing at all.

So, I wanted to write this to "announce" to myself that I will be collapsing the Notes and TILs into my the Posts type. This, fingers crossed, will allow me to write more freely without the mental overhead of categorizing my thoughts into these different types.

This post is more for me than general consumption. It's a way to hold myself accountable.

I'll need to make sure that I create the right set of redirects so that I don't break any pre-existing links. Oh, and then I'll update the CLI that I built to remove the post type selection step. It had been so long since I'd written anything, I could not even remember what I called the CLI. I had to go through my node-scripts folder to find it.

Onward!

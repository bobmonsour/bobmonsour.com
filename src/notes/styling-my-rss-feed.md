What is it about the web that there's this endless, yet wonderful cycle of people showing how they do things? The latest thing I've taken on is styling my [RSS feed](/feed.xml).

Now, rather than get just a glob of XML thrown in your face, you get a reasonably nice looking list of posts. Go ahead and click on that link above and you'll see what I mean.

The most recent inspiration for this was [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co]) and her post titled [How to make your RSS feed pretty](https://cassidoo.co/post/prettify-rss/). I also looked back on a post that I had recalled from [Darek Kay](https://darekkay.com/) and his post titled [Style your RSS feed](https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-styling/).

If you're thinking of doing this, both of those are excellent entry points to get started. If you want to see my own XSL file, it's [here on GitHub](https://github.com/bobmonsour/bobmonsour.com/blob/main/src/assets/css/feed.xsl).

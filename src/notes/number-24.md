My wife and I watched Number 24 yesterday. Borrowing from this imdb description:

_"Young apprentice Gunnar Sønsteby from Rjukan decides to resist Nazi-Germany on the day of the invasion to later become the leader of the "Oslo-gang" carrying out countless daring acts of sabotage making him Norway's greatest war hero._"

It starts out as a lecture by a very elderly Gunnar Sønsteby to a group of what appear to be high school students. It then goes into footage of his younger self carrying out incredible resistance activities during the Nazi occupation of Norway. It's a very moving portrayal of an incredibly brave Norwegian. I highly recommend it.

<p>Welcome to my shop, where you can buy one thing...a sticker for the <a href="https://11tybundle.dev">11ty Bundle website</a>. Tax and shipping are included in the price. They've been successfully shipped to the UK, Portugal, New Zealand, and Taiwan, as well as the east and west coasts of the US. Designed by <a href="https://www.andycarolan.com/">Andy Carolan</a>, it's 4" x 2" with a matte finish and based on this design.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="/blog/got-stickers/">blog post about how this came to be a thing</a>. And here's what it looks like on my laptop.</p>

<p>If you do decide to buy one and put it on your laptop (or anything else), I'd love to see some images shared on social media. You can find me on <a href="https://indieweb.social/@bobmonsour">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bobmonsour.com">Bluesky</a>.</p>

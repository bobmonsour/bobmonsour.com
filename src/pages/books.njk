<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Inspired by many of the other <em>bookshelves</em> that I've seen on other sites (<a href="https://coryd.dev/books">Cory Dransfeldt's</a>, <a href="https://sean.voisen.org/bookshelf/">Sean Voisen's</a>, <a href="https://melanie-richards.com/currently/reading/">Melanie Richards's</a>, <a href="https://thisguise.wtf/bookshelf/">Chazz Basuta's</a>, and <a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf">Dave Rupert's</a>), here are some of the books that I've read over the years. It is nowhere near a complete list, with the most accurate info being from more recent years.</p>

<p>The bulk of the information came from entries I've made on the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> platform (exported and hacked as I'll describe in a future blog post).</p>

<p>The ratings are my own, and as you can see, I like most of what I've read. And while I know the year when I read some of these books, there's also an <a href="#undated">Undated section</a> at the end. I'll likely add more to that section as I mine my physical bookshelves for data.</p>

	<h2 class="bookyear">Currently Reading</h2>

			{# if we're changing years and it's not the first year,
				close the 'bklist' div on the prior year, set the heading id

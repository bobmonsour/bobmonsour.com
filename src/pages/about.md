Brooklyn-born, New Jersey raised, educated in Florida and Los Angeles. I'm now retired and living in Northern California.

I've had the privilege of working in the technology industry from the late 70s through early 2000. I was fortunate to work on a lot of interesting projects, both on the technical side of things as well as the business side.

For a career view, it's probably best to look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobmonsour/).

Some of the more interesting projects that I've worked on include the [Motorola BPR2000 Pager](https://historyexplorer.si.edu/resource/motorola-bpr2000-pager), the [Tono-Pen](https://patents.google.com/patent/US4747296), and Stacker by [Stac Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stac_Electronics), of which I was a co-founder. Following my time at Stac, I joined a spin-off of the company called Hifn. As part of that work, I co-authored two IETF RFCs which brought lossless compression technology to internet payloads, the [IP Payload Compression Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2393), and [IP Payload Compression Using LZS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2395), Hifn's proprietary compression technology.

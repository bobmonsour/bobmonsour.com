Hi! I'm Bob Monsour.

Brooklyn-born, New Jersey-raised, and educated in Florida and Los Angeles, I'm now retired and living in Northern California with my wonderful [wife and artist](https://www.tascafineart.com/), Sandra, and our Portuguese Water Dog, Soda. Our son is out on his own and lives in Los Angeles.

<p>When we're not traveling, I enjoy trying to stay fit and being a part of the community of web developers who use the static site generator <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>. A big part of that is maintaining a <a href="https://11tybundle.dev">website</a> and <a href="https://buttondown.com/11tybundle">newsletter</a> called the <a href="https://11tybundle.dev">11ty Bundle</a>.</p>

<p>I've had the privilege of working in the technology industry from the late 70s through early 2000. I was fortunate to work on a lot of interesting projects, both on the technical and the business side.</p>

For a career view, it's probably best to look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobmonsour/).

Some of the more interesting projects that I've worked on include the [Motorola BPR2000 Pager](https://historyexplorer.si.edu/resource/motorola-bpr2000-pager), the [Tono-Pen](https://patents.google.com/patent/US4747296), and Stacker by [Stac Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stac_Electronics), of which I was a co-founder. Following my time at Stac, I joined a spin-off of the company called Hifn. As part of that work, I co-authored two IETF RFCs which brought lossless compression technology to internet payloads, the [IP Payload Compression Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2393), and [IP Payload Compression Using LZS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2395), Hifn's proprietary compression technology.

Most recently (meaning early 2023), I've fallen head over heels with the static site generator called [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). This website is built with it and I've been following its development and use, reading articles to learn how to use it, and writing my own articles to share what I've learned. I've <s>started creating a series of blog posts that I call The 11ty Bundle</s> created a new website called [11tybundle.dev](https://11tybundle.dev/). The original blog posts have been duplicated there with some new ones added. <s>Each issue</s> The site contains a curated list of Eleventy releases, blog posts, sites, and resources. I collect these from my RSS reader, <s>Twitter,</s> Mastodon, Discord, and wherever I can find them. There seems to be no shortage of people writing about how they use various aspects of Eleventy. I'm having fun doing it and learning a lot along the way.

As of now, I'm envisioning creating a dedicated site for this set of resources. _UPDATE:_ [vision realized](https://11tybundle.dev/). Ultimately, I'd like to make it possible for members of the Eleventy community to submit their own resources for inclusion in the bundle. I'm not sure how I'll do that yet, but I'm sure I'll figure it out. The community is very active and supportive. I try to pitch in and answer some of the simpler questions on the Eleventy Discord server.

I'm very glad that I've found something technically interesting and useful to sink my teeth into. I'm also glad that I've found a community of people who are willing to share their knowledge and help others. I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds.

    <p class="top-margin">For the last 12 years, I have been a supporter of Just Vision, a non-profit organization that <i>"fills a media gap on Israel-Palestine through independent storytelling and strategic audience engagement."</i> They have produced <a href="https://justvision.org/films" data-link-type="external">award-winning films</a>. They also produce <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/" data-link-type="external">Local Call</a>, a Hebrew-language news site advancing citizen journalism and an independent media. In conjunction with <a href="https://www.972mag.com/" data-link-type="external">972 Magazine</a>, Local Call publishes <a href="https://www.972mag.com/topic/local-call/" data-link-type="external">their work in English</a>.

    <p class="top-margin">Brady United is the leading gun violence prevention organization in America. They combine bipartisan leadership with proven behavior change campaigns. Evidence shows they're saving lives. A friend of mine and organizer of our book club recently hosted a gathering at his home where we heard <a href="https://www.bradyunited.org/about-us/our-team/brady-leadership/kris-brown" data-link-type="external">Kris Brown</a>, the President of the <a href="https://www.bradyunited.org/" data-link-type="external">Brady Campaign</a>, speak about the work they are doing to address this issue.

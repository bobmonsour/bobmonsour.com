	<p>Hi! I'm Bob Monsour.</p>

	<p>Brooklyn-born, New Jersey-raised, and educated in Florida and Los Angeles, I'm now retired and living in Northern California with my wonderful <a href="https://www.tascafineart.com/">wife and artist</a>, Sandra, and our Portuguese Water Dog, <a href="/soda/">Soda</a>. Our son is out on his own and lives in Los Angeles.</p>

	<p>We travel occasionally and I enjoy reading and trying to stay fit. I'm also having fun being a part of the community of web developers who make and use the static site generator <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>. A big part of that is maintaining a <a href="https://11tybundle.dev">website</a> and <a href="https://buttondown.com/11tybundle">newsletter</a> called the <a href="https://11tybundle.dev">11ty Bundle</a>.</p>

	<p>I've had the privilege of working in the technology industry, beginning in the late 70s. I was fortunate to work on a lot of interesting projects with some really great people.</p>

	<p>There's a little more about me on the aptly-named <a href="/about/">about page</a>.
